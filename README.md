Everything I wrote for this is CC0, any referenced plugins/addons will be licensed in accordance with whatever license is indicated in the addon folder.

Art assets will include a `SOURCE.txt` file that indicated both where it is from and the license it is under. 

## Goal

An exploration on a means of making a player world feel big whilst not permitting free movement, as well as some misc exploration around mechanics for viewing locations.

## Non Goals
  * This is not meant to be a game, and won't have any mechanics. 
  * Visual quality will be only to the degree needed to convey the sense of being in a real place.
  * This is not designed to be used as an asset or plugin for your game. You'll need to do some legwork here.
